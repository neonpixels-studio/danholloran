# Dependency vulnerability gate for CI.
# Runs `npm audit`, prints a severity summary, and fails the build when there is
# at least one high or critical *advisory* that is not on the accepted allowlist
# below. Moderate and low are reported but never fail the build.
# Dev dependencies are intentionally in scope: build/test tooling runs in CI
# and on developer machines, so its advisories matter here.
#
# Blocking is measured per distinct advisory (GHSA id), not per affected package.
# npm's package-level counts inflate a single root advisory into every package
# that pulls it in transitively. Counting advisories keeps the gate honest about
# how many real, un-remediated flaws exist.
#
# ALLOWLIST POLICY: only advisories with no upstream fix belong here, each with a
# justification and a trigger to remove it. This is NOT a way to silence fixable
# findings — prefer `npm update <pkg>` (or an `overrides` bump if the parent's
# declared range excludes the patched version) every time a fix is available.
#
# Entries are keyed "<GHSA-id>@<node_modules path>" so an exemption only covers
# the exact install location it was justified for, not every copy of the
# advisory anywhere in the tree. KNOWN LIMITATION: a package with multiple
# advisories AND multiple install paths could still produce a pair that
# doesn't really apply (npm audit's JSON doesn't cleanly separate that). Every
# affected package here has exactly one install path today, so this doesn't
# bite; re-verify if that changes.
