// `]]>` closes a CDATA section. The `feed` library wraps every item title,
// description, and body in CDATA and its XML serializer escapes only the first
// occurrence per field, so any of them containing the sequence twice would
// prematurely close the section and corrupt the whole feed document.
// Neutralize every terminator by entity-encoding its closing bracket. The
// `<description>` and `content:encoded` body are rendered as HTML by feed
// readers, so a spec-compliant reader decodes `]]&gt;` back to the original
// literal text; the RSS `<title>` is plain text, so the entity shows literally
// there — an accepted trade for not breaking the document.

// omitted (a described, titleless item is already valid RSS). `description` is

// here — the same trim that decides whether a description element ships. An

// of dropping non-string tags rather than coercing them into a laundered
// label. Trimming and dropping the empty result additionally keeps a blank or
// whitespace-only tag from shipping as a junk `<category>` element (`tagBuckets`
// gets the same outcome for free via its route-slugging step, which isn't
// appropriate to reuse here). Deduping after the trim stops two tags that
// differ only by surrounding whitespace (e.g. "js" and " js ") from shipping
