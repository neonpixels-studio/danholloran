Bun entered the JavaScript runtime conversation with benchmarks that were hard to ignore, and the 1.0 release in 2023 made it a serious option for production use. A year-plus later, with the ecosystem having had time to actually use it, the picture is more nuanced than "Bun is faster, just switch." Here's how to think about it.

## What Bun Actually Is

Bun isn't just a runtime — it's a four-in-one tool:

- **Runtime**: Executes JavaScript and TypeScript using JavaScriptCore (Safari's engine) instead of V8
- **Package manager**: Drop-in replacement for npm/yarn/pnpm, significantly faster installs
- **Bundler**: Built-in bundler with an esbuild-compatible API
- **Test runner**: `bun test` with Jest-compatible APIs

The runtime executes TypeScript natively — no `ts-node`, no compilation step. That alone removes a layer of tooling for many projects.

## The Speed Claims Are Real (With Caveats)

Bun's startup time and throughput numbers are genuinely impressive:

```bash
# Package install comparison (rough real-world times)
npm install        # ~8s for a medium project
pnpm install       # ~3s
bun install        # ~0.8s

# HTTP server (requests/second on typical benchmark)
# Bun:  ~90,000 rps
# Node: ~55,000 rps
```

The HTTP throughput difference is meaningful for high-traffic servers. The install speed difference is meaningful for CI/CD pipelines. But for the vast majority of application code — database queries, business logic, external API calls — the bottleneck isn't the runtime.

## Node.js Compatibility Is Good but Not Perfect

Bun implements the Node.js API surface intentionally, and most packages just work:

```ts
// This works in Bun unchanged
import { createServer } from "http";
import { readFileSync } from "fs";
import express from "express";

const app = express();
app.get("/", (req, res) => res.send("Hello from Bun"));
app.listen(3000);
```

Where you hit friction is with native Node.js addons (`.node` files compiled via `node-gyp`) — these don't work in Bun. If your project depends on packages that use native addons (some database drivers, sharp for image processing, certain crypto libraries), you'll need to find alternatives or stay on Node.

## Where Bun Wins Clearly

For new projects or internal tooling, three scenarios make Bun a clear winner:

```ts
// 1. Script runner — no compilation step, just run TypeScript
// scripts/migrate.ts
import { db } from "./db";
await db.migrate();

// bun run scripts/migrate.ts — works without ts-node or tsx

// 2. Fast test runner in CI
// bun test is Jest-compatible but meaningfully faster
// Jest: ~8s for 200 tests
// bun test: ~1.2s for the same suite

// 3. Bun.serve() for lightweight servers
Bun.serve({
  port: 3000,
  fetch(req) {
    return new Response("Hello, Bun!");
  },
});
```

## The Honest Verdict

If you're building a new project with no native addon dependencies, Bun is worth trying — especially if fast CI and TypeScript-without-compilation matter to you. For existing Node.js projects, the migration cost is real and the runtime speed gains usually don't move the needle on overall application performance.

The package manager story is the easiest win: `bun install` in a Node.js project is safe, fast, and compatible with your existing lockfile workflow. Start there before committing to a full runtime switch.
