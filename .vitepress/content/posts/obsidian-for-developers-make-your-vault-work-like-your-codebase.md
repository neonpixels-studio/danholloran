Most note-taking apps treat your writing as something locked inside a proprietary database. You can export, sure, but the canonical copy lives somewhere you don't control, in a format you can't diff. For developers that's a constant low-grade itch. We spend all day in plain-text files under version control, and then we're supposed to keep our actual thinking in a black box?

Obsidian scratches that itch. Every note is a `.md` file on your disk. There's no sync server you're forced to trust, no database to corrupt, no export step. That single design decision means the entire toolchain you already know — Git, your terminal, your editor — works on your notes too. Here's how to lean into that.

## Put your vault under Git

Because a vault is just a folder of markdown, you can `git init` it like any other project. That gives you free, versioned backups, a full history of every edit, and sync across machines without paying for a sync service. You can even keep notes next to a codebase in the same repo if you want documentation to travel with the code.

The friction is that committing by hand interrupts your flow. The [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) community plugin fixes that. It can auto-commit and push on a timer, and it adds a Source Control view for staging, a History view for browsing commits, and a Diff view for inspecting changes — all without leaving the app. A reasonable starting config:

```
Auto commit-and-sync interval: 10 minutes
Auto pull on startup: enabled
Commit message: vault backup: {{date}}
```

Push to a private GitHub or GitLab repo and you've got the same disaster-recovery story you'd expect from any project. Pull on a second device and your notes show up, conflicts and all, resolved the way you already know how to resolve them.

One caveat: large binary attachments bloat history fast. Either keep images in a separate folder you `.gitignore`, or wire up Git LFS if you must track them.

## Get code blocks that actually look like code

Obsidian ships with Prism-based syntax highlighting, so a fenced block with a language tag is highlighted out of the box:

````markdown
```ts
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}
```
````

That covers the basics, but developer notes tend to be code-heavy enough that you want more. The [Code Styler](https://github.com/mayurankv/Obsidian-Code-Styler) plugin adds line numbers, a header bar with the language and an optional filename, collapsible blocks, and click-to-copy buttons. For inline tweaks you don't even need a plugin — a CSS snippet dropped in `.obsidian/snippets/` and toggled on under Settings → Appearance → CSS snippets will do it:

```css
.markdown-rendered pre {
  font-size: 0.85em;
  border-radius: 8px;
  border: 1px solid var(--background-modifier-border);
}
```

If Prism doesn't highlight a niche language the way you'd like, the Style Settings plugin exposes theme variables without writing CSS, and several themes expose code-block colors directly.

## Run JavaScript inside your notes

This is where Obsidian stops feeling like a notes app and starts feeling like a tiny programmable environment. The [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin lets you query your vault like a database, and its `dataviewjs` mode hands you a full JavaScript API:

````markdown
```dataviewjs
const pages = dv.pages('"projects"')
  .where(p => p.status === "active")
  .sort(p => p.due, 'asc');
dv.table(["Project", "Due"], pages.map(p => [p.file.link, p.due]));
```
````

That block renders a live, always-current table of every active project note, sorted by due date. Pair it with [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater), which runs JavaScript when you insert a template, and you can auto-generate frontmatter, pull the current Git branch into a daily note, or scaffold a new file from a prompt. For shared logic, both plugins let you point at a folder of `.js` files and import your own functions, so you're not copy-pasting the same snippet into thirty notes.

## The payoff

None of this requires abandoning the way you already work. The vault is text, the history is Git, the customization is CSS, and the automation is JavaScript — four things you reach for every day anyway. Start small: put your vault under Obsidian Git this week, then add Code Styler when your notes get code-heavy, then reach for `dataviewjs` the first time you catch yourself manually maintaining a list that a query could generate. The tools you trust for code turn out to work just as well on the thinking that produces it.
