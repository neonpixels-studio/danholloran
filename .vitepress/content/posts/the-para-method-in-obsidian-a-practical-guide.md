If you've ever opened Obsidian, stared at a growing pile of notes, and wondered where anything actually goes, you're not alone. Most people start with good intentions — maybe a folder for "Work", one for "Personal", one for "Ideas" — and end up with a chaotic mess within a month. The PARA method offers a different approach: organize by what you're going to _do_ with information, not by what it _is_.

Developed by Tiago Forte as part of his Building a Second Brain framework, PARA gives you four top-level buckets that cover every piece of information you'll ever capture.

## The Four Buckets

**Projects** are things you're actively working on right now with a defined endpoint. Writing a conference talk, planning a road trip, shipping a feature — these are Projects. The key distinction: a Project has a finish line. When you hit it, the Project gets archived.

**Areas** are ongoing responsibilities with no end date and a standard of performance you want to maintain. Your health, your finances, your role as a team lead — these don't get completed, they just continue. Areas are where you keep notes that relate to something you're perpetually responsible for.

**Resources** is your reference library. Topics you find interesting and want to come back to: CSS techniques, cooking notes, book highlights, research on a programming language you're learning. Resources support your work but aren't immediately actionable.

**Archives** is the inactive pile. Completed projects, old areas that no longer apply, resources you've outgrown. Critically, you don't delete things — you archive them. They stay searchable; they just stop cluttering your active folders.

The four categories are intentionally ranked by actionability. Projects are most actionable (you need them _now_), Archives are least (you need them _occasionally_). When you're deciding where a note goes, ask: "Is this connected to something I'm actively working on?"

## Setting It Up in Obsidian

The mechanical setup is straightforward. Create four top-level folders in your vault:

```
1 - Projects/
2 - Areas/
3 - Resources/
4 - Archives/
0 - Inbox/
```

The numbers force sidebar ordering. The Inbox is essential — more on that in a moment.

Inside each top-level folder, create one subfolder per project, area, or resource topic. Resist the urge to go deeper than two levels. A hierarchy like `Projects/Website Redesign/Design/Mockups/v2/` is a maintenance nightmare. Keep it flat: `Projects/Website Redesign/`.

Here's what a realistic vault structure looks like after a few weeks:

```
1 - Projects/
  Conference Talk - ReactConf 2026/
  Kitchen Renovation/
  Blog Post - PARA Guide/
2 - Areas/
  Health/
  Finances/
  Career/
3 - Resources/
  CSS Reference/
  Book Notes/
  Obsidian Tips/
4 - Archives/
  Project - Old Freelance Client/
  Area - Previous Job/
0 - Inbox/
```

## The Inbox: The Piece Most People Skip

The Inbox is arguably the most important part of making PARA actually work. The instinct is to file notes directly into the right folder as you capture them. In practice, mid-capture filing creates friction and misfiling. The better workflow: dump everything into Inbox first, then run a weekly triage.

Once a week (15 minutes is enough), go through every note in your Inbox and ask:

- Is this connected to an active Project? → Move it there.
- Is it an ongoing responsibility? → Move it to the matching Area.
- Is it reference material with no current action? → Move it to Resources.
- Is it already done or no longer relevant? → Archive it immediately, or delete it.

This rhythm keeps your active folders clean and ensures nothing important gets buried. Obsidian's Quick Switcher (`Cmd+O`) and drag-and-drop in the file explorer make the triage process quick once you have the habit.

## PARA + Links: A Hybrid That Actually Works

One criticism of folder-heavy systems like PARA is that they can work against Obsidian's linking model. Folders imply a note lives in exactly one place; links let a note connect to many contexts simultaneously.

The good news: these approaches complement each other. Use PARA for _where a note lives_, and use `[[wikilinks]]` for _how notes relate_. A research note on CSS container queries lives in `Resources/CSS Reference/`, but it can be linked from whatever Project or Area note needs it.

Many experienced Obsidian users also layer in Maps of Content (MOCs) — index notes that link to all the notes in a given topic area. A `CSS Reference MOC` in your Resources folder becomes the entry point to everything CSS-related in your vault, regardless of how deeply nested any individual note might be.

## When PARA Feels Wrong

PARA works best when you have active projects with clear goals. If most of your Obsidian use is research-heavy, writing-heavy, or knowledge-for-its-own-sake — academic note-taking, journaling, creative writing — a pure PARA setup can feel like forcing a productivity framework onto something that isn't a productivity problem.

In those cases, consider using PARA only for your top level while letting individual sections follow whatever structure makes sense. Your `Projects/` folder might contain tightly organized project notes; your `Resources/` folder might look more like a Zettelkasten. The buckets are guidelines, not constraints.

## A Vault That Works for You

The biggest mistake with PARA (or any organizational system) is treating it as permanent. Tiago Forte explicitly designed it to be rearranged. Projects become Areas when they stop having endpoints. Areas become Archives when you change jobs or life situations. Resources move to Projects when you're suddenly actively using them.

Set it up, use it for a month, and then adjust. The point isn't a perfectly organized vault — it's a vault where you can find what you need when you need it. PARA gives you a framework flexible enough to actually get you there.
