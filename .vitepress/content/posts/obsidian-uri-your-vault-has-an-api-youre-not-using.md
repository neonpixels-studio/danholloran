Most Obsidian capture workflows stop at the app boundary. You have templates, hotkeys, maybe a QuickAdd macro that files things perfectly — and all of it requires you to already be in Obsidian. So the idea you had while reading a changelog in your browser goes into a scratch file, and the note you meant to append from a terminal never gets appended.

The fix has been sitting in the app since the beginning. Obsidian registers a custom URI protocol on your OS, which means anything that can open a link can also drive your vault. No plugin, no HTTP server, no API key.

## The core protocol, no plugin required

Obsidian URIs follow a single shape:

```
obsidian://action?param1=value&param2=value
```

The built-in actions are `open`, `new`, `daily`, `unique`, `search`, and `choose-vault`. That covers more than it sounds like:

```bash
# Open a specific note
open "obsidian://open?vault=my%20vault&file=projects%2Froadmap"

# Create a note with content, in a new tab
open "obsidian://new?vault=my%20vault&name=meeting%20notes&content=Hello&paneType=tab"

# Append the clipboard to today's daily note without stealing focus
open "obsidian://daily?vault=my%20vault&clipboard&append&silent"

# Run a search
open "obsidian://search?vault=my%20vault&query=tag%3A%23inbox"
```

That third one is the sleeper. `clipboard` pulls content from the system clipboard instead of the URL, `append` adds to the existing note rather than replacing it, and `silent` means Obsidian does the write without pulling you out of whatever you were doing. Chained together, that's a full capture pipeline in one line.

A few details that will bite you if you skip them. Encoding is not optional: a bare `/` in a path or a space in a vault name will break the parse, so percent-encode everything (`%2F`, `%20`). The `.md` extension can be omitted from `file`. `paneType` accepts `tab`, `split`, or `window`. And there's a shorthand if you're hand-writing links inside notes — `obsidian://vault/my vault/my note` is the same as the long `open` form.

## Where Advanced URI picks up the slack

The core protocol can create and append. It cannot overwrite a specific heading, run a command, or do a regex search-and-replace. That's what [Advanced URI](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri) is for. It uses its own scheme, `obsidian://adv-uri`, and adds a `mode` parameter:

```bash
# Append to a specific heading in today's daily note
open "obsidian://adv-uri?vault=my%20vault&daily=true&heading=Log&data=Deployed%20v2.1&mode=append"

# Overwrite a file outright
open "obsidian://adv-uri?vault=my%20vault&filepath=status&data=green&mode=overwrite"
```

`mode` takes `write` (only if the file doesn't exist), `overwrite`, `append`, `prepend`, and `new` (always creates, appending an incrementing number on collision). Append and prepend default to a newline separator, but `separator=,` or anything else works if you're building a list.

Two features are worth the install on their own. The first is running commands by ID:

```
obsidian://adv-uri?vault=my%20vault&filepath=notes%2Fdraft&commandid=workspace%3Aclose
```

That switches to the tab holding `notes/draft` and then fires the "Close current tab" command — so you can close an arbitrary tab by path. Any command in the palette works. Prefer `commandid` over `commandname`; names get reworded between plugin releases, IDs almost never do.

The second is the `uid` identifier. Instead of `filepath`, you reference a note by a UUID stored in its frontmatter:

```
obsidian://adv-uri?vault=my%20vault&uid=d43f7a17-058c-4aea-b8dc-515ea646825a
```

Rename or move the note and the link still resolves. If you're embedding Obsidian links into task managers, calendar events, or a codebase, this is the difference between links that survive a vault reorg and links that quietly rot.

## Making it actually useful

The protocol is only worth it if something else is calling it. A shell function is the lowest-effort win:

```bash
jot() {
  local text
  text=$(python3 -c 'import sys,urllib.parse; print(urllib.parse.quote(sys.argv[1]))' "$*")
  open "obsidian://daily?vault=my%20vault&content=- ${text}&append&silent"
}
```

Now `jot "check why the build cache missed"` lands in today's daily note from any terminal, and Obsidian never comes to the foreground. The same URL works as a browser bookmarklet, an iOS Shortcut action, a Raycast script, or a step in a cron job.

One nicety before you start hand-writing these: Advanced URI ships helper commands in the palette that generate and copy a correct, fully encoded URI for the current file, daily note, command, or search-and-replace. Use those to get a working URL, then edit it — it's a lot faster than debugging your own percent-encoding at midnight.
