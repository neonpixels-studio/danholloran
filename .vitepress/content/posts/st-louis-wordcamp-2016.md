WordCamp St. Louis was held this year again at Washington University St. Louis on May 14-15 2016. Over all it was a good time I always enjoy going to WordCamps. I figured I would post my notes here [like I did last year](http://danholloran.me/2015/03/15/st-louis-wordcamp-2015/) just cause. I have added the slides that where available as of this posting you can checkout the full listing [here](https://2016.stlouis.wordcamp.org/2016/05/16/speaker-slides-round-up/). Some of the later notes on Saturday kind of trailed off because I decided to fix my blog after a few issues with Github Pages and Jekyll 3. One of the downfalls to Jekyll being so easy to write with being Markdown at its core and all makes it sometimes difficult to upgrade.

### Optimizing Your Themes for Responsive Images in WordPress

- Use cases [responsive.images.org](http://responsive.images.org)
- srcset & &lt;picture&gt;

- srcset W descriptors - width defaults to full width of viewport
- [Picturefill polyfill](https://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/)
- [Responsive Images 101](http://blog.cloudfour.com/responsive-images-101-definitions/) (Cloud Four Blog)
- Only works on same aspect ratio sizes (soft crops)

### The Future of WordPress: Five Years Out

- Your expectations are too high for 1 year and too low for 5 years
- You need a life and hobbies it helps you find problems to solve
- WordPress managed and owned by community
- Everyone can contribute

### WordPress Query Optimization and Best Practices

- `update_post_meta => false` Primes the post meta cache
- Only disable `update_post_meta` when you are sure that no post meta will be used
- `wp_cache_set` ([docs](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_cache_set)) and `wp_cache_get`([docs](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_cache_get)) caching for a single request cycle
- [Transients](https://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API) can be used for persistent caching

### Code Review: Keeping Things Secure, Clean, and Performant

- [Slides](http://www.slideshare.net/ryanmarkel/ryan-markel-wordcamp-stl-2016-code-review)

- [WP Enforcer](https://github.com/stevegrunwell/wp-enforcer)
- [VIP Quickstart](https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/vip/quickstart/) - Vagrant

### Hardening WordPress, Again

- WordPress 4 major releases since March 2015 (St. Louis WordCamp 2015)
- [Panama Papers](https://panamapapers.icij.org/) - [Revolution Slider](https://revolution.themepunch.com/) vulnerability
- ImageMagick vulnerability
- Update your sites
- BruteProtect -> Jetpack Protect
- 98% vulnerabilities in WordPress security updates due to 3rd party code
- [Automattic Security White Paper](https://wordpress.org/about/security/)
- Include maintenance on fixed bids
- To help prevent attacks you tradeoff convenience for security
- Security is not just on WordPress
- DNS Proxies
- Network Firewall
- Server Firewall
- Web App Firewall
- Plugin firewall
- [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)
- Machine BFD (CPHulk)
- Update permissions so only uploads are writeable unless you are upgrading WordPress

### Automating WordPress Plugin Development with Gulp

- [Slides](http://www.slideshare.net/mikehale1/automating-wordpress-plugin-development-with-gulp)
  [WebDevStudios - Generator Plugin WP](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/generator-plugin-wp)
  Plugin header placeholder tokens (Like handlebars `{value}`)

### Podcast Panel

- Building [Google PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/) module for NGINX sucks...
- It was a good panel but see previous note.

### Why WordPress Works this Way

- G.R.I.P.I. (Goals.Roles.Information.Process.Interpersonal)
- Unified project philosophy
- Philosophy driven development
- Democratize publishing
- WordPress should work out of the box
- As little configuration as possible
- Design for the majority of users
- Solid array of basic features
- Users shouldn't have to know/care what version of PHP they are on. (I agree but they should be aware that it needs to be upgraded from time to time. Just like a cars oil you wouldn't go 10 years without changing your oil...)
- Decisions not options
- Options are expensive
- [Havoc Pennington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havoc_Pennington) - Author/Writer
- Options hard on QA and UI
- Striving for simplicity
- Accessibility
- Deadlines are not arbitrary
- Document flows
- Don't just study the code. Philosophy is important as well
- Philosophy drives development

## Casual AMA/Hangout/Networking/Closing Notes

- I still do not understand why [Genesis Framework](http://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis/) is helpful. If the biggest value is to add hooks to templates you could have edited on your own just does not make any sense. I guess if you view it from an implementor instead of a developers mind set it would make more sense.
