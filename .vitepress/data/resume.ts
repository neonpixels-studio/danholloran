  intro: `Senior Frontend & Fullstack Developer with ${getExperienceLength()}+ years building performant, scalable web applications. Passionate about architecture, mentorship, and finding the right tool for the job.`,
  summary: `Dynamic Senior Frontend &amp; Fullstack Developer with <strong class="text-fg font-semibold">${getExperienceLength()}+ years</strong> of experience building responsive, performant web applications and leading engineering teams. Proven track record of reducing load times, improving user engagement, and directing cross-functional teams of 10+ developers. Equally comfortable owning complex frontend architecture with Vue.js and React, diving into Fullstack work with Laravel and PHP, or stepping into an engineering leadership role. I build and operate my own AI agent tooling and fold AI coding agents into my daily development workflow, with 5+ years of TypeScript across Vue/Nuxt and React work. Looking to bring deep technical expertise and a collaborative leadership style to an innovative startup or mid-sized product team, remotely.`,
